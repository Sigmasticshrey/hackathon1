First, we will be hosting Parent-Teacher Conferences on October 10-11. Please prepare to engage with parents about their childrenâ€™s progress and any concerns. Following that, we have Homecoming Week from <strong>October 14-18h</strong>, which will involve various activities to foster school spirit. Your involvement in these activities is crucial for encouraging student participation. Additionally, Midterm Exams are scheduled for <strong>October 28-31</strong>, so please ensure that all materials and assessments are ready. We will also have our Fall Festival on October 25, and I encourage you to support your students in the planning and execution of this event. Lastly, please remind your students about our Community Service Day on<strong>November 5</strong>  and ensure they are aware of our Thanksgiving Break from November 23-27.
